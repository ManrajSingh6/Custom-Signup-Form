# Custom-Signup-Form
Created a custom email list signup form as a Full-stack web-application.

Created the front-end using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript.

The back-end was created using NodeJS and ExpressJS.

All user data is sent to MailChimp using the MailChimp API, and stored in their database.

The final web-application was deployed using Heroku.
